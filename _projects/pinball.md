A modification to the classic pinball game in C++ by adding multiplayer feature. This project was done as a part of the Object Oriented Programming course.

Language: C++

Libraries used: SFML

Pinball game is a simulated collection of the pinball table. Pinball is a type of arcade game, in which points are scored by a player manipulating one or more steel balls on a play field inside a glass-covered cabinet called a pinball machine (or "pinball table").  The primary objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. Points are earned when the ball strikes different targets on the play field. A drain is situated at the bottom of the play field, partially protected by player-controlled plastic bats called flippers. A game ends after all the balls fall into the drain a certain number of times. Secondary objectives are to maximize the time spent playing (by earning "extra balls" and keeping the ball in play as long as possible) and to earn bonus games (known as "replays").

There have been many versions of computer simulations of pinball. The ubiquitous version of the game that everyone has heard of, is the space cadet version, which was included in past versions of windows. Named as 3D Pinball for Windows – Space Cadet, it was originally packaged with Microsoft Plus! 95 and later included in Windows NT 4.0, Windows ME, Windows 2000, the 32-bit editions of Windows XP and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition. Windows XP was the last client release of Windows to include this game. Many open source modifications and fancy pinball games are also available in the internet. This project has been inspired from Pinball Versus developed by PinballBox.
