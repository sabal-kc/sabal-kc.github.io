Implemented the visualization of several path-finding algorithms:

<ul>
    <li> A* algorithm </li>
    <li> Breadth first search </li>
    <li>  Depth first search</li>
    <li> Dijkstra's algorithm </li>
    <li> Greedy best first search </li>
</ul>

The green and red spheres are the start and end nodes of the desired path. You can click and drag to adjust accordingly. If you click on any cube in the path, it turns red to indicate an obstacle, meaning the path cannot be traversed through it. There is also an option to select 4 way or 8 way connection, with the latter alleviating the restriction of a diagonal traversal.
