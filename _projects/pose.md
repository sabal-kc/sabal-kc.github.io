<b> Abstract </b>

Fitness exercises are good for personal health. However doing ‘wrong’ or ineffectively can be no good and may lead to injury. There are certain exercises that experts want people to stop due to complications and risk involved in
incorrectly performing them. Exercise mistakes are often introduced when users lack understanding about the pose and proper form of the exercise. In our work, we introduce an application that detects the user’s exercise, evaluates
their pose according to the exercise and provides feedback about the exercise along with the additional feature of exercise tracking at real time.
