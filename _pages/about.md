Greetings! I'm Sabal K.C., a passionate software engineer from Kathmandu, Nepal with over 3 years of experience in software development.

My expertise lies in backend development using Golang, where I relish the challenge of building efficient and scalable systems. I am also adept at nodeJS and express. On the frontend, I harness the power of javascript and react to create engaging user interfaces that blend form with function seamlessly. Furthermore, I have developed my skills in web scraping and automation with Puppeteer, allowing me to extract valuable insights from the vast expanse of the internet. This combination of skills empowers me to architect end-to-end solutions that not only meet the needs of today but are also poised for the challenges of tomorrow.

I always strive to learn new tools and technologies, and am always eager to tackle new challenges head-on.
